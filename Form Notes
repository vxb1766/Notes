```
 state = {
        orderForm: {
            name: {
                elementType: 'input',
                elementConfig: {
                    type: 'text',
                    placeholder: 'Your Name'
                },
                value: ''
            }
       }
}
```
Whenever u are updating the form and changing the value, u need to do immutably.
var dummy = {...this.state.orderForm}

But here u still have not cloned this deeply as name,elementConfig is nested object. so u can do
var name = {...dummy}
dummy["orderform"]["name"] = name;
